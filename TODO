* Print out nice unicode key representation instead of "Eb" for instance
* Center align texts
* Bigger current chord display
* "potentials": color other keys from the keyboard in the color as if they
  would have been pressed too (probably only that of neighbours)
* ALSA midi connection
  * make jack dependency optional
* Dynamic size
* ability to specify split key
* break up render functions into own .hs files
[X] ability to give the render function custom color functions so that
    the coloring can be turned of easily (in case its annoying)
